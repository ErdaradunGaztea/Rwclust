## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs. 

There were two NOTEs:

* The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
  'Random walk clustering on weighted graphs'
  In title case that is:
  Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  'Random Walk Clustering on Weighted Graphs'

Will resubmit after fixing this.

* Found the following files/directories:
    'lastMiKTeXException'

I am unable to reproduce this locally with `R CMD check`.
